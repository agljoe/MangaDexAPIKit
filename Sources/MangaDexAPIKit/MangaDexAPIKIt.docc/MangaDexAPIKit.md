# ``MangaDexAPIKit``

A Swiftier way to interact with the MangaDexAPI.

## Overview

MangaDexAPIKit provides a native way to use the MangaDexAPI with Apple standard APIs such as `URLSession`. Retrieved data is both type safe and thread safe, allowing you to easily use it in concurrently executing contexts.

This library is primarly focused on retrieving data, thus some endpoints are not implemented, other endpionts that return heterogeneous JSON data that is unreasonably difficult to decode are also excluded.
