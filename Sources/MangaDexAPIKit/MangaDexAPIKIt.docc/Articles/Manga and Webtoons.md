# Manga

A comic or graphic novel that is read left to right.

## Overview

Manga are primarly retrieved through the get manga enpoint, but can be found in the reference expansion of some other types. As objects found in any reference expansion array do not contain any references it is necessary to add alternate "manga" types for efficient decoding.

MangaDex also hosts webtoons, and long strips which are accessible through the get manga endpoint for the sake of simplicity.
