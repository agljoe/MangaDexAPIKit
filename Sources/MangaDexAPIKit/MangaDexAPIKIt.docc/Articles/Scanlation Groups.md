# Scanlation Groups and Users

A group of people who translate manga.

## Overview

When presenting any manga hosted by MangaDex credit must be given its translators also known as "scanlators". Scanlation groups had dedicated pages containing their members, active, and past translations. Most groups will have one focused language, to filter by language pass an ISO 639-1 standard code as a URL query parameter. 

The members of a scanlation group can be found in its reference expansion.
