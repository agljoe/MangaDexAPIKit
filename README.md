This is the result of 2 years of figuring out how to interact with the MangaDexAPI only using native Swift code. Efficient? Maybe not, but a fun and interesting challenge nonetheles.

Note that some things such as rate limits and UserDefaults are implemented for my use cases, so you are recommended to fork this repository and make changes as you see fit.
